# Playing with Gaia Data 

HR diagram.ipnyb => Using Gaia DR2 Database to map out 10000 nearest stars into a color-magnitude-temperature diagram (and comparing where do stars from M87 and M45 fall on the same diagram) as well as mapping out the relative positions of the nearest 10000 stars in 3 Dimensions.

I made this notebook as a part of the [Intro to Astro 2021](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2021) program by Howard Isaacson.
